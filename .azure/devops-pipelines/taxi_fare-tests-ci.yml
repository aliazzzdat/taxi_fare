# This Azure Pipeline runs unit and integration tests.
# This pipeline is triggered upon making a PR against the main branch.
# Unit tests are defined under taxi_fare/tests
# and are executed on the Azure Pipelines agent.
# The integration test deploys and runs the model_training_job defined in taxi_fare/resources/model-workflow-resource.yml
# This integration test is run in the staging workspace, as defined under taxi_fare/databricks.yml
