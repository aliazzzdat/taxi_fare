# taxi-fare

This directory contains an ML project based on the default
[Databricks MLOps Stacks](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks),
defining a production-grade ML pipeline for automated retraining and batch inference of an ML model on tabular data.

See the full pipeline structure below. The [MLOps Stacks README](https://github.com/databricks/mlops-stacks/blob/main/Pipeline.md)
contains additional details on how ML pipelines are tested and deployed across each of the dev, staging, prod environments below.

## Using this repo

The table below links to detailed docs explaining how to use this repo for different use cases.

This project comes with example ML code to train, validate and deploy a regression model to predict NYC taxi fares.
If you're a data scientist just getting started with this repo for a brand new ML project, we recommend 
adapting the provided example code to your ML problem. Then making and 
testing ML code changes on Databricks or your local machine. Follow the instructions from
the [ML quickstart](docs/ml-developer-guide-fs.md).
 

When you're satisfied with initial ML experimentation (e.g. validated that a model with reasonable performance can be
trained on your dataset) and ready to deploy production training/inference
pipelines, ask your ops team to follow the [MLOps setup guide](docs/mlops-setup.md) to configure CI/CD and deploy 
production ML pipelines.

After that, follow the [ML pull request guide](docs/ml-pull-request.md)
and [ML asset config guide](taxi_fare/assets/README.md) to propose, test, and deploy changes to production ML code (e.g. update model parameters)
or pipeline assets (e.g. use a larger instance type for model training) via pull request.

## Monorepo

It's possible to use the repo as a monorepo that contains multiple projects. All projects share the same workspaces and service principals.

For example, assuming there's existing repo with root directory name `monorepo_root_dir` and project name `project1`
1. Create another project from `databricks bundle init` with project name `project2` and root directory name `project2`.
2. Copy the internal directory `project2/project2` to root directory of existing repo `monorepo_root_dir/project2`.
3. Copy yaml files from `project2/.github/workflows/` to `monorepo_root_dir/.github/workflows/` and make sure there's no name conflicts.

## Getting started

1. In the project folder, run the following commands `databricks bundle validate`
2. In the project folder, run the following commands `databricks bundle deploy -t dev` to deploy in the dev environment
3. In the project folder, run the following commands `databricks bundle run -t dev` to run the code in the dev environment

## TO DO

1. Add a FeatureFunction (on-demand features with FeatureStore) and Online Store ?
2. Fix model serving deployment when model uses a feature store (fix from Databricks expected at the beginning of Feb)
3. Add choice FS model or not FS model 
4. Add AutoML experiment ? 
5. Edit modelization and use sklearn pipeline
6. Add hyperopt experimentation ?
7. Add unit tests
8. Create one cluster and use it for all jobs/tasks
9. Edit CI/CD pipelines
10. Use MLflow recipe ?
